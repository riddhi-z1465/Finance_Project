# Finance Application

A web application for managing finances. This project is split into a frontend and a backend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

*   `/frontend`: Contains the client-side application.
*   `/backend`: Contains the server-side application and API.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.  Install dependencies for the backend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  Install dependencies for the frontend:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

You will need to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.

### Backend

To start the backend server, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend

To start the frontend application, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once both are running, you should be able to access the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
